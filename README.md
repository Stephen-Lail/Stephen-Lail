## Hi there 👋
--------------------------------------------------------------------
My Name is Stephen Lail and I am a MS Marine Science Student at UNCW  <br>
🔭 I'm currently working on a novel Biogeochemical Drifter design found here: https://github.com/COAST-Lab/Biogeochemical-Drifter.   <br> 
This drifter is going to be used for studying dissolved oxygen dynamics in tidal creeks as apart of my MS project. <br>
🌱 I'm currently analyzing field data using Jupyter Notebook from my recent field tests with the drifter.  <br>
📫 You can reach me at sml6042@uncw.edu if you have any questions <br>
