## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
--------------------------------------------------------------------
My Name is Stephen Lail and I am a MS Marine Science Student at UNCW  <br>
ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a novel Biogeochemical Drifter design found here: https://github.com/COAST-Lab/Biogeochemical-Drifter.  <br> 
This drifter is going to be used for studying dissolved oxygen dynamics in tidal creeks. <br>
ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning python and how it can be used to process physical and chemical sensor data   <br>
ðŸ“« You can reach me at sml6042@uncw.edu if you have any questions <br>
